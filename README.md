# Google Homepage reconstruction

## About

This is my solution to [The Front End Project: Google Homepage](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css) in The Odin Project's Web Development Foundations Module. The task was to deconstruct and re-build the (Google homepage)[https://www.google.com/].

### Live Demo

(Here!)[https://kath-ldn.github.io/google-homepage/]

### Built with

HTML & CSS only.

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Roadmap & known issues

This was my first mini-project with The Odin Project! If I were to approach it now, I would likely do it a little differently (and probably a lot quicker). I've neatened up the HTML/CSS from the original, but if I were to spend more time on it I would:

* add SVG icons to the Search Bar
* increase responsiveness to match Google page (currently only works on desktop)
* refactor code to reduce/reuse it further.

However, perfection is the enemy of progress, so I am going to leave this be and move on to other things ;)
