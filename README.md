Hello

This is me imitating the Google Homepage

By the end of this I will hopefully have learned more about HTML, CSS, positioning content on the page and making it look GOOOOD.

This will help me in building my own stuff.

I cannot work out how to do the app-grid - I will leave that for a later date!
